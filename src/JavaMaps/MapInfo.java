//    When storing any key value arrangement, maps shout be the first data structure that we think about.
//    Maps use keys and values
//    Keys are technically stored in the Set Class as they are unique [can't contain duplicates]
//    Values are technically stored in the List Class .
//    Map basically reuses the things from Collections in Java

//    Look at the JavaMapsHierarchy.png
//    From we see the word sorted we know that the things that follow will follow some kind of sorted order.
//    We know that TreeMaps provides sorted order.
//    Sort order is only applicable to the keys

//    HashMaps provide random access and it will not maintain an insertion order or will it provide a natural sorting order.

//    HashTables are inherently thread safe. They are slower because it does not allow synchronized access.
//    Only a single thread can access the table at a time.
